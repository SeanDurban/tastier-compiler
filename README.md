# tastier-compiler
Compiler for Tastier language which supports:
* Arrays
* Constants
* For and while loops
* Conditional statements
* Parameters are passed by reference

## Getting Started
Within the coco folder run the command

``` 
make build 
```

This will produce a compiler for the language Tastier (described in the file Tastier.ATG). 
Following run the command 
```
make compile
```
This will produce TastierProject.s an ARM file for the program TastierProgram.TAS. Which is combined with TastierProjectHeader.s and TastierProjectFooter.s to produce the TastierProject.s file.

Add the TastierProject.s file into the keil folder and run it using the Keil IDE

## Project Structure
The CocoTastierProject directory contains the following files:
* Coco.exe – the Coco/R compiler-compiler
* *.frame –frame files used by Coco.exe during the construction of a compiler
* *.cs – mainline and support routines used by the parser generated by Coco.exe
* Tastier.ATG – attributed translation grammar (input into Coco.exe) describing the language for which the compiler is to be generated (Tastier)
* TastierProgram.TAS – sample/test program
* TastierProjectHeader.s and TastierProjectFooter.s
* *.html – files describing the original (Taste) and modified (Tastier) grammars
* Makefile – with instructions to build the compiler and compile Tastier programs
